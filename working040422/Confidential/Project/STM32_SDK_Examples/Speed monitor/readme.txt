@par Example Description 

This example describes how to generate a PWM signal in order to provide the information 
of Electrical Speed of the motor. This signal is generated in RUN mode only.

The PWM timer is configured in Toggle and Up counting mode with a prescaler set for 
very low frequency generation (2MHz). The Autoreload preload function has been defined in 
order to provide the new value before each PWM period.
The ARR register is modified according with the electrical angle calculated through API 
(SPD_GetAvrgMecSpeed01Hz) and number of poles.
 
MC-Lib API used:

- SPD_GetAvrgMecSpeed01Hz()

@par Directory contents 

  - Speed monitor/Speed monitor_F1.c     Example configuration file

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32F1xx Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STM3210E-EVAL and MB459 with Shinano motor and 
    it can be easily tailored to any other development board.

  - STM3210E-EVAL Set-up
    - Use the GPIO pin (PA3) of the Eval board for PWM output.

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following:

 - Use the ST Motor Control Workbench application to configure this
   STM32 PMSM FOC library v4.0 opening the WB file created for STM3210E-EVAL 
 - From IAR application open the workspace file named as "STM32F10x_Example"
 - Select the right example from drop box menu
 - Press F8 to batch-build the entire workspace (select a proper project configuration, 
   according to the uC part in use);
 - Read the messages window and download the firmware;
 - Run the example
