@par Example Description 

This example describes how to use the API in order to change the FOC control mode 
between Speed and Torque mode.
The motor starts in torque mode with a ramp defined by a torque (torque_value) and 
a torque ramp duration (torque_duration). When the mechanical speed goes above the
threshold (speed_threshold) the motor moves in Speed Control with a its ramp defined
by speed_target and speed_duration.
 
MC-Lib API used:

- MCI_ExecTorqueRamp()
- MCI_StartMotor()
- SPD_GetAvrgMecSpeed01Hz()
- MCI_ExecSpeedRamp()

  - Torque and Speed mode/TqSpeedMode_F1     Example configuration file

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32F1xx Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STM3210E-EVAL and MB459 with Shinano motor and 
    it can be easily tailored to any other development board.

  - STM3210E-EVAL Set-up

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following:

 - Use the ST Motor Control Workbench application to configure this
   STM32 PMSM FOC library v4.0 opening the WB file created for STM3210E-EVAL 
 - From IAR application open the workspace file named as "STM32F10x_Example"
 - Select the right example from drop box menu
 - Press F8 to batch-build the entire workspace (select a proper project configuration, 
   according to the uC part in use);
 - Read the messages window and download the firmware;
 - Run the example
